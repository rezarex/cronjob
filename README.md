# Dowell Opensource License Compatibility Library

## Version 0.1.0

## Description

The DoWell Legalzard Package provides a seamless interface to the Legalzard API powered
by [DoWell UX Living Lab](https://uxlivinglab.com/en/).

The Legalzard API provides access to a wide range of legal information and resources. It allows developers to retrieve
information about software licenses, legal documents, legal entities, check license compatibility, and more. The API
aims to facilitate the integration of legal information into applications, websites, or other software systems.

## Installation

Download or clone the project
from [github](https://github.com/DoWellLabs/Opensource-License-Compatibility/tree/legalzard-Dennis) to the root of your
project.

## Usage

Import the package

```python
from legalzard import Legalzard
```

Create an instance of the API. You use this instance to access all the package-API methods

```python
license = Legalzard(api_key='YOUR-VALID-API-KEY')
```

### Features

This library offers all the features through the Legalzard API

1. Creating Licenses
   Use the method ```get_all```
   Get all licenses submitted.
   The method returns a response body with two parameters, ```isSucsess```, a boolean showing retrieval status
   and ```data```, a list of licenses.

2. Retrieving all licenses
   Create a license by adding all the fields required by using the ```create``` method which accepts one argument in the
   form of a dictionary. This argument contains all the license information to be created.

3. Retrieving a single license
   Retrieve license information using an ID by using the method ```retrieve``` and passing an Id. The response is
   similar to the ```get_all``` method but the list of of licenses only contains a single license.
4. Updating a license
   Use the ```update``` method. This method updates the license information stored on the database. It accepts two
   arguments, ```id``` and ```license``` object as a dictionary similar to what the ```create``` method accepts.
5. Deleting a license
   Using the ```delete``` method pass an ```id``` and to remove license.
6. Searching for a license
   The API the feature of search for licenses containing a specific phrase. The method accepts a ```search_term```
   argument and returns a response object similar to the ```get_all``` method with list of matching licenses.
7. Retrieving license compatibility.
   Use the ```check_compatibility``` method to check the level of compatibility of two licenses.
   The method accepts a ```comparison_data``` dictionary.
8. Check Comparison History
   Get the comparison history by user using the ```get_compatibility_history``` method that accepts two
   arguments, ```organization_id``` and ```user_id```. The response object contains a list of comparison history
   objects.pip
